## Key Concepts

- **Unsupervised Learning**: A type of machine learning where the model is trained on unlabeled data.
- **Clustering**: Grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group are more similar to each other than to those in other groups.
- **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**: Computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains.
- **Recommendation Systems**: Systems designed to recommend items to users based on various algorithms and data analysis techniques.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: A method of making automatic predictions about the interests of a user by collecting preferences from many users.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: A method of recommending items based on the features of the items and a profile of the user's preferences.

## Libraries Used
