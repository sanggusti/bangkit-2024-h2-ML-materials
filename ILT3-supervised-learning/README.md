# ILT 3: Supervised Learning, Concepts and Applications

## Introduction

This module covers the concepts and applications of supervised learning. It includes hands-on exercises with classification and regression models using Python and popular machine learning libraries.

## Notebooks

- [ILT_3_Hands_on_Classification_Model.ipynb](ILT_3_Hands_on_Classification_Model.ipynb): This notebook demonstrates various classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machines. It also covers model evaluation techniques such as cross-validation and classification reports.
- [ILT_3_Hands_on_Regression_Model.ipynb](ILT_3_Hands_on_Regression_Model.ipynb): This notebook focuses on regression models, including Linear Regression and Gradient Boosting Regressor. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Key Concepts

- **Supervised Learning**: A type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data.
- **Classification**: Predicting the category or class of an instance.
- **Regression**: Predicting a continuous value for an instance.
- **Model Evaluation**: Techniques to assess the performance of a model, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Libraries Used

- `scikit-learn`: A machine learning library for Python that provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis.
- `pandas`: A data manipulation and analysis library for Python.
- `numpy`: A library for numerical computations in Python.

## Getting Started

To get started with the notebooks, you need to have Python installed along with the required libraries. You can install the dependencies using the following command:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
